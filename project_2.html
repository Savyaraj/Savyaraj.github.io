						 During the summer of 2018, I visited The Ohio State University under Research Internship for Young Academics Program where I worked in the Acoustics and Dynamics Laboratory on nonlinear modelling of rubber vibration isolators. These devices are widely used in industries such as automobiles, aviation, sensitive instruments as well as civil structures. Their main purpose is to protect the important parts of device or structure from unwanted external vibrations. Although there have been extensive studies on their modelling, many nonlinear phenomena are still not well understood, one of which is chaotic behavior in certain class of oscillators. To explain this, a new nonlinear element called 'clearance' was introduced in the system. I started off with simulating the established models and analyzing individual nonlinearities and their interactions. This framework was then extended to incorporate clearance nonlinearity. During this journey, I discovered many new concepts such as the somewhat unintuitive concept of fractional calculus for viscoelastic forces, nontrivial interactions of friction and elastic forces, the rich nonlinear dynamics of clearance.</p>

							<p>Since I was part of this internship program with 6 other students, I had the opportunity to interact and get acquainted with diverse research avenues in the field of mechanical engineering.</p>
